Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

This assignment was very good training in terms of stacks and queues. For me the most interesting part was to handle the error with left- vs. Right-Associativity for the power formula. 

This assignment does lend itself to more visual prototyping, so please feel free to go this route. Are you including slides, pseudocode, comments, or something else? I do drafting but usually it is hard to follow (contains random ideas often completely unrelated to the final solution)
